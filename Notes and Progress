Apparently there was a M4 competition (last year?) and this is a link for the winning model:

Kaggle discussion about the large gaps of 0 sales: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/discussion/138085
This is about how to handle the large gaps of zeros. A few possible explanations are given, but that data would normally come from the client. The main thing we need to focus on is being able to determine which extended periods of zeros are due to seasonal sales or due to lack of stock, etc.

This guys provides a code for making dynamic time series plots (scrolling plots) - this looks pretty awesome

Apparently this guys does a TON of time series analysis

Pretty good walk through of some visualizations of the data: https://www.kaggle.com/tpmeli/visual-guide-3-m5-baselines-eda-sarima

Feature engineering notebooks I have no read yet (author seems to be pretty good in other discussions):

Particular items with indeterminate zero sales
FOODS_1_011_CA_1_validation - Potential seasonal, but also probably not
FOODS_1_021_CA_1_validation - Just a nice plot
FOODS_1_031_CA_1_validation - Probably indeterminate zeros
HOBBIES_1_008_CA_1_validation - Has what appears to be a legitimate discount
HOBBIES_1_011_CA_1_validation - Not sure
HOBBIES_1_021_CA_1_validation - Probably indeterminate zeros, but may be too far back to worry about
HOBBIES_1_031_CA_1_validation - Pretty consistent, but with a couple spots of zeros
HOUSEHOLD_1_011_CA_1_validation - Recent problematic stretch of indeterminate zeros
HOUSEHOLD_1_021_CA_1_validation - Actually looks pretty good
HOUSEHOLD_1_032_CA_1_validation - Definitely problematic indeterminate zeros
